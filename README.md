# Scarborough-Build-a-game-with-Node-and-Express

I cloned Ben's repository.  Then I updated files to make the project work.  But I don't want to commit the changes to Ben' original repository.

So, I forked his repository (that's this one) and I committed by changes to this.  I'll next clone this for further work.
